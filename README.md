# game-gallery

This is a personal project inspired by the 2020 CiGA 48hr Game Jam. I wanted to record stories behind the development of the games during the event,
and possibly those for future events.

This site is built with node.js, express, and mongoDB. CSS framework is Semantic UI (sadly no react or angular just yet, I still need to learn them).
The site is currently deployed on Heroku, and images are stored on Google Cloud Storage, db is on MongoDB Atlas.

If you want to join the development of this website, please feel free to reach out to me at fengruigan@gmail.com
